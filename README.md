# PlutoTestNotebooks
 Experiments demonstrating interactive elements in Pluto notebooks.  Some of these could be added to PlutoUI if they are useful enough.
 
 View static versions of the notebooks at https://jekyllstein.github.io/PlutoTestNotebooks/
 
 Once notebooks are open, you can find further instructions to run them locally or on a cloud service.
